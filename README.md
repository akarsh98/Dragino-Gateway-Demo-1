In this project, We are going to create a LoRa based Wide Area Network also known as LoRaWAN. For this purpose we have with us the LoRaWAN Gateway LG01-P from Dragino. So what we are going to do is that we will setup the gateway and link it up with TheThingsNetwork which is our Server for the day. While setting up the Gateway we follow steps such as connecting the Gateway to WiFi, Registering the network, Adding a new device, and setting up an application to control the device. Apart from the LoRaWAN Gateway we will be using an Arduino UNO connected with LoRa module which will act as a Node connected to the gateway and will send data to it.

The Arduino used to transmit data is coded in such a manner that it continuously generates random numbers and those numbers are sent to the Server through Gateway and on the Server page the data received can be seen. The LoRaWAN technology is a more powerfu version of the normal LoRa technology because it uses LoRa in combination with the Internet which signifacantly increases the capacity, Range and the Scalability of the Network and hence provide us a more powerful solution to be equiped in the IoT applications.
